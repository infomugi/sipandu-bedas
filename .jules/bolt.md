## 2026-03-12 - Cartesian Product in PostgreSQL JOINs
**Learning:** Joining multiple one-to-many relationships (like members and visits) with LEFT JOIN and then grouping creates a Cartesian product (M * V rows per parent) before aggregation, causing severe performance issues as data grows.
**Action:** Replace multiple one-to-many LEFT JOINs with correlated subqueries or lateral joins to avoid the Cartesian explosion entirely.
