## 2024-05-18 - [Authentication Bypass in Login]
**Vulnerability:** The `/api/auth/login` endpoint retrieved user data using only the NIK, completely skipping password validation (`if (password !== rows[0].password)` was missing). It also returned the entire user row, leaking the password hash.
**Learning:** An endpoint might exist that asks for a password but fails to check it against the database record, leading to an easy authentication bypass. The codebase also returned `SELECT *` essentially (fetching password too) and returning it to the user.
**Prevention:** Always verify passwords explicitly. Destructure or `delete` sensitive fields from response objects to avoid unintentional data leaks.
